## How to use :

You just have to launch `./wakeUp.py` :)


This little script use `machines.py`, generated by `generateMachines.py`.
This file is already generated.

But if you want to regenerate it, with for example the addition of a new room, you need to install (On debian based distribution):

```bash
sudo pip3 install pyvirtualdisplay selenium
sudo apt install xvfb firefox-geckodriver beautifulsoup4
```

And then, you just have to launch `./generateMachines.py`.
